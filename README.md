## 🎠 PanelSurya

PanelSurya is a simple interactive web-based command panel designed to simulate a lightweight system console interface. This project combines a toggleable sidebar navigation, a command input system, and a dynamic output log, all built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external frameworks.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen fundamental front-end skills, especially DOM manipulation, basic state control, and event-driven logic in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML – for structure
- CSS – for layout and styling
- JavaScript – for logic, navigation, and dynamic content

## Command System Logic
PanelSurya supports a basic command system using arrays and condition checks.
- Supported commands:
  - /help → Displays a list of available commands
  - /yt → Simulates loading, then opens YouTube in a new tab
  - /roblox → Reserved for future implementation

- How it works:
  - User input is validated against a predefined commands array
  - Valid commands generate dynamic output messages
  - Invalid commands display an error message in red
  - All outputs are added to the DOM without refreshing the page
